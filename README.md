# Neo64YT

## Notice
Almost all of my repositories are now primarily hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) and this account only serves as a mirror to my [account there](https://codeberg.org/neo64yt) (except for my "fork" of [revanced-magisk-module](https://github.com/neo64yt/revanced-magisk-module), as this repository relies heavily on GitHub Actions). Any opened issue or pull request to one of my repositories on GitHub will be simply ignored. So, please go to Codeberg instead or better yet, send me an email.
