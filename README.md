* A stranger you found on Github
* A random guy you found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPUeyD6WkLAN_idjMHVPBWw)
* A tech & Linux enthusiast 💻🐧
* For some reason, he has a very [questionable but useful (not sure about this) repository](https://github.com/neo64yt/hello-collection)
* Still learning 👀
* Interested in suckless software
* That's all you need to know. Now stop reading this!

My website (WIP): https://neo64yt.github.io/

**NOTE**: I'm currently migrating all of my repositories (including my website) to Codeberg. However, they'll still be available on GitHub and GitLab as mirrors.
